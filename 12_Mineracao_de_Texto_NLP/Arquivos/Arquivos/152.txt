'CHINESE WHEAT CROP THREATENED BY PESTS, DISEASE Chinas wheat crop this year is seriously
threatened by plant pests and diseases, the New China News
Agency said.
    More than 5 mln hectares of wheat-producing land in North
China could be affected because relatively warm and dry weather
had allowed bacteria and insect eggs to survive the winter, the
agency added.
    Chinas Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and
Fisheries has called for measures including the timely supply
of pesticides to farmers to combat the threat, it said.
